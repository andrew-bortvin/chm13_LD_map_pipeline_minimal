# chm13_LD_map_pipeline_minimal

Concise version of the recombination mapping pipeline that can (mostly) be run locally. The one step where this is not feasible is the creation of lookup tables - this step is time consuming even on a cluster. 

Pyrho is run from a conda environment, `my-pyrho-env`. The yaml file for this environment can be found in the root directory of this repository.
