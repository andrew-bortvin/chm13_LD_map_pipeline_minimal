# Inputs

This directory contains all files necessary as inputs for the pipeline. 

Namely: 

* `smcpp_popsizes_1kg` - smc++ estimates of historical population sizes for each population in the 1KGP dataset
* `make_table_pop_sizes.txt` - the sample sizes of each population in 1KGP, along with that number times 1.5, used as the Moran size for hyperparameter estimation
